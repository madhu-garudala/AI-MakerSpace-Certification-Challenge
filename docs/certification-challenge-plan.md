## Task 1: Defining the Problem and Audience

### Problem Statement (1 sentence)

Parents lack a quick, reliable way to assess the safety and appropriateness of store-bought food products for their children based on ingredient lists, leading to uncertainty and potential health risks.

### Why This is a Problem (Detailed)

Every day, millions of parents stand in grocery aisles trying to decode ingredient labels on food products. The fine print is often overwhelming, filled with chemical names, preservatives, and additives that most people don't recognize. Parents want to make healthy, safe choices for their children, but they face several challenges:

1. **Information Overload**: A typical packaged food item can contain 20-50+ ingredients. Parents don't have time to research each one while shopping or at home.

2. **Hidden Dangers**: Many ingredients that seem harmless have concerning effects on children's health. Artificial food dyes have been linked to hyperactivity, certain preservatives may cause allergic reactions, and excessive sugar/sodium content contributes to childhood obesity and other health issues.

3. **Allergen Complexity**: With food allergies affecting 1 in 13 children in the US (approximately 6 million children), parents must be vigilant about cross-contamination and hidden allergens. An ingredient like "natural flavoring" could contain allergens.

4. **Age-Appropriate Concerns**: What's safe for a 10-year-old may not be safe for a toddler. Choking hazards, developmental considerations, and digestive system maturity all vary by age, but labels rarely provide this context.

5. **Conflicting Information**: Parents receive mixed messages from various sources - social media, blogs, friends, and even different medical professionals - making it hard to know what to trust.

This problem is especially acute for:
- **Working parents** who need to make quick decisions during limited shopping time
- **Parents of children with allergies** who face potentially life-threatening consequences from ingredient mistakes
- **Health-conscious parents** overwhelmed by marketing claims vs. actual ingredient quality
- **First-time parents** who lack experience in evaluating food safety for children

The consequence of this problem is that parents either:
- Spend excessive time researching (20-30 minutes per product initially)
- Make uninformed decisions that may negatively impact their child's health
- Experience anxiety and decision fatigue around feeding their children
- Miss important red flags in ingredient lists

### Target User Questions

Parents using this application are likely to ask:

1. "Is this Fruit Loops cereal box safe for my 5-year-old?"
2. "What's wrong with Red Dye #40 that I keep hearing about?"
3. "Can I give this granola bar to my toddler, or is it a choking hazard?"
4. "This says 'all natural' - does that mean it's healthy for kids?"
5. "My child has a peanut allergy - is there any risk with this product?"
6. "How much sugar is too much sugar for a snack?"
7. "What are the side effects of the preservatives in this product?"
8. "Is organic really better, or is it just marketing?"
9. "Can I trust products with ingredients I can't pronounce?"
10. "What's a better alternative to this product?"

### User Profile

**Primary User:** Parents and primary caregivers of children (ages 0-18)

**Job Function Being Automated:** 
- Manual ingredient research and evaluation
- Cross-referencing allergen databases

**The "Better World" for Our User:**

Sarah can now shop with her phone, quickly check any product she's unsure about, and make decisions backed by comprehensive nutritional science. She spends less time stressed in grocery aisles and more time confident in her choices. Over time, she learns which ingredients to avoid and which are safe, becoming a more empowered consumer. Most importantly, she has peace of mind knowing she's protecting her child's health with every purchase.

### Technology Stack and Tooling Decisions

#### 1. **LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o**
**Reasoning**: GPT-4o provides excellent reasoning capabilities for complex ingredient analysis, strong instruction following for structured output (percentage scores + explanations), and good knowledge of nutrition and chemistry. It also supports function calling for our agentic approach.

#### 2. **Embedding Model: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large**
**Reasoning**: This model offers 3072 dimensions with strong performance on domain-specific technical content (medical/nutritional guidelines). It performs well on semantic similarity for ingredient matching and regulatory document retrieval.

#### 3. **Orchestration: LangGraph**
**Reasoning**: LangGraph enables us to build a stateful multi-agent system where different agents handle different aspects of ingredient analysis (allergen detection, nutritional evaluation, additive assessment). It provides clear state management and allows for complex agentic reasoning flows.

#### 4. **Vector Database: Qdrant**
**Reasoning**: Qdrant offers excellent performance for semantic search, easy local deployment for development, and smooth cloud migration path for production. It supports filtering by metadata (e.g., document type, date) which is crucial for regulatory documents with time-sensitive validity.

#### 5. **Monitoring: LangSmith**
**Reasoning**: LangSmith provides comprehensive tracing for LangChain/LangGraph applications, allowing us to monitor agent decisions, track token usage, debug reasoning chains, and identify performance bottlenecks in our agentic RAG pipeline.

#### 6. **Evaluation: RAGAS**
**Reasoning**: RAGAS specializes in RAG evaluation with metrics specifically designed for our use case: faithfulness (is the safety score grounded in retrieved guidelines?), context precision (are we retrieving relevant nutritional data?), and answer relevancy (does our explanation address the parent's concern?).

#### 7. **User Interface: Streamlit**
**Reasoning**: Streamlit enables rapid prototyping of an intuitive web interface with minimal code, supports real-time updates as the analysis progresses, and provides built-in components for displaying structured data (scores, tables, charts). It's perfect for MVP and demo purposes.

#### 8. **Serving & Inference: Local Python (MVP), Future: AWS Lambda + API Gateway**
**Reasoning**: For the certification challenge, local Python execution is sufficient. For production, serverless architecture (Lambda) would provide cost-effective scaling since usage is likely sporadic (shopping trips) rather than continuous.

### Agentic Reasoning Architecture

**Primary Agent System: Multi-Agent Specialist Team**

Our application uses agentic reasoning through a **Supervisor + Specialist Agents** architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Supervisor Agent (Coordinator)      │
│  - Receives ingredient list             │
│  - Routes to specialist agents          │
│  - Synthesizes final score & report     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┬──────────┐
        ▼           ▼           ▼          ▼
┌─────────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│  Allergen   │ │ Additive │ │Nutrition │ │   Safety    │
│   Agent     │ │  Agent   │ │  Agent   │ │   Agent     │
│  (RAG Tool) │ │(RAG Tool)│ │(RAG Tool)│ │ (RAG Tool)  │
└─────────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

**Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **Supervisor Agent**
   - Parses ingredient list into individual components
   - Routes each ingredient to appropriate specialist agents
   - Aggregates scores from all specialists
   - Generates final percentage score using weighted formula
   - Compiles comprehensive report

2. **Allergen Detection Agent**
   - **Tool**: RAG search over FDA allergen database and FALCPA documentation
   - **Reasoning**: Identifies common allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans)
   - **Scoring**: Presence of major allergens = automatic alerts; hidden allergens = score reduction
   - **Output**: Allergen risk level and specific warnings

3. **Additive & Preservative Agent**
   - **Tool**: RAG search over FDA food additive regulations and pediatric health studies
   - **Reasoning**: Evaluates artificial colors, flavors, preservatives (BHA, BHT, sodium benzoate, etc.)
   - **Scoring**: Assigns safety scores based on research linking additives to health concerns in children
   - **Output**: List of concerning additives with health impact explanations

4. **Nutritional Analysis Agent**
   - **Tool**: RAG search over USDA dietary guidelines for children and WHO recommendations
   - **Reasoning**: Evaluates sugar, sodium, fat content, and nutritional density
   - **Scoring**: Compares values against age-appropriate daily limits
   - **Output**: Nutritional quality score and excessive content warnings

5. **Physical Safety Agent**
   - **Tool**: RAG search over AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) choking hazard guidelines
   - **Reasoning**: Evaluates ingredient forms/textures for choking risks
   - **Scoring**: Identifies high-risk ingredients (whole nuts, hard candies, etc.)
   - **Output**: Physical safety concerns and age recommendations

**Why This Agentic Approach:**

- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on one domain, allowing for deeper, more accurate analysis
- **Explainability**: Individual agent outputs provide transparent reasoning for the final score
- **Modularity**: Easy to add new agents (e.g., environmental impact agent, ethical sourcing agent)
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents can analyze different aspects simultaneously
- **Context-Aware**: Agents can query specific knowledge bases relevant to their domain

**Scoring Formula (Weighted):**
```
Final Score = 
  (Allergen Score × 0.30) +        # Highest weight - safety critical
  (Additive Score × 0.25) +         # High weight - health impact
  (Nutrition Score × 0.25) +        # High weight - long-term health
  (Physical Safety Score × 0.20)    # Important - immediate safety
```

Each specialist agent returns a 0-100 score for their domain, which are then weighted and combined by the Supervisor Agent.

   - Source: [FDA.gov Food Labeling Guide](https://www.fda.gov/food/guidance-regulation-food-and-dietary-supplements/food-labeling-nutrition)
   - Usage: Regulatory definitions, labeling requirements, approved additives list
   - Format: PDF documents
   - Why: Official regulatory standards for food safety in the US

2. **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Nutrition Guidelines**
   - Source: [AAP HealthyChildren.org Nutrition Resources](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/)
   - Usage: Age-appropriate nutritional recommendations, feeding guidelines, safety warnings
   - Format: PDF/Web scraped content

   - Usage: Recommended daily intake limits for sugar, sodium, fats for children
   - Format: PDF documents
   - Why: National nutrition standards with specific recommendations for children

4. **FDA Food Additives Status List**
   - Source: [FDA Food Additive Status List](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/food-additive-status-list)
   - Usage: Comprehensive list of approved additives, GRAS substances, and regulated preservatives
   - Format: CSV/Structured data
   - Why: Complete reference for additive safety status

5. **Common Food Allergen Database (FALCPA)**
   - Source: FDA Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act documentation
   - Usage: Major allergen identification, cross-contamination risks
   - Format: PDF/Structured data
   - Why: Legal requirements for allergen disclosure

6. **Research Studies on Food Additives and Children's Health**
   - Source: PubMed/NIH literature on artificial dyes, preservatives, and childhood health
   - Usage: Evidence for health impact assessments
   - Format: PDF research papers
   - Why: Peer-reviewed scientific evidence for scoring logic

7. **AAP Choking Hazard Prevention Guidelines**
   - Source: AAP choking prevention resources
   - Usage: Physical safety assessment of food textures/forms
   - Format: PDF guidelines
   - Why: Age-specific physical safety standards

### External APIs

1. **Tavily Search API**
   - **Usage**: Real-time search for recent studies, product recalls, updated FDA warnings
   - **Why**: Nutritional science and food regulations evolve rapidly; need current information beyond our static RAG documents
   - **Example Query**: "Latest FDA warning on artificial food dyes 2025"

2. **OpenFDA API** (Bonus)
   - **Usage**: Query food recall data, adverse event reports
   - **Why**: Identify products or ingredients with recent safety issues
   - **Integration Point**: Cross-check ingredients against recall database

### Chunking Strategy

**Selected Strategy: Hierarchical Semantic Chunking**

**Approach:**
1. **Document-level metadata**: Store document type, source, publication date, authority level
2. **Section-level chunking**: Split documents by sections (e.g., "Allergen Guidelines", "Additive Safety", "Age-Specific Recommendations")
3. **Chunk size**: 500-800 tokens per chunk with 100-token overlap
4. **Parent-child relationships**: Maintain context by linking chunks to parent sections

**Why This Decision:**

- **Regulatory documents** have clear hierarchical structure (sections, subsections) that should be preserved
- **Context preservation**: Nutritional guidelines often have prerequisites or conditions (e.g., "for children under 3") that must stay with recommendations
- **Metadata filtering**: Allows specialist agents to filter by document type (allergen agent queries allergen docs)
- **Optimal retrieval**: 500-800 tokens provides enough context for LLM understanding without overwhelming with irrelevant information
- **Overlap**: 100-token overlap ensures we don't lose critical information at chunk boundaries (e.g., "children under 2 should avoid..." split across chunks)

**Alternative Considered:**
- **Fixed-size chunking**: Rejected because it splits logical concepts mid-sentence
- **Sentence-level**: Rejected because nutritional guidelines often require multiple sentences for full context

### Specialized Data Needs

**Scoring Rubric Knowledge Base**

Beyond RAG for ingredient information, we need a **structured scoring rubric** that defines:
- Weight factors for different concerns
- Age-specific multipliers
- Severity classifications for additives
- Threshold values for sugar/sodium content

This will be maintained as a **structured JSON configuration file** separate from the RAG pipeline, allowing easy updates to scoring logic without retraining or re-embedding documents.

**Example structure:**
```json
{
  "allergens": {
    "major_allergens": ["milk", "eggs", "peanuts"...],
    "severity_scores": {"high": 0, "medium": 50, "low": 80}
  },
  "additives": {
    "red_dye_40": {"score": 40, "reason": "linked to hyperactivity"},
    "sodium_benzoate": {"score": 60, "reason": "preservative with moderate concerns"}
  },
  "nutritional_thresholds": {
    "sugar_per_serving_grams": {"high": ">12g", "medium": "6-12g", "low": "<6g"}
  }
}
```

This separation ensures:
- **Transparency**: Clear logic for score calculations
- **Auditability**: Parents can understand how scores are derived
- **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust weights based on new research or user feedback

*(Note: Actual code implementation deferred per user request)*

---

## Task 5: Creating a Golden Test Data Set

### Test Data Set Strategy

**Approach: Synthetic Data Generation + Real-World Examples**

We will create a **golden test dataset** combining:
1. Real ingredient lists from common children's food products
2. Synthetically generated test cases covering edge cases
3. Expected outputs (ground truth safety scores and explanations)

### Dataset Composition

**Size:** 50 test cases distributed across:

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Major Allergen Products** | 10 | Products containing common allergens (peanuts, dairy, eggs, etc.) |
| **High Sugar Products** | 10 | Candies, sugary cereals, juice boxes |
| **Artificial Additive Products** | 10 | Products with dyes, artificial flavors, preservatives |
| **Clean/Healthy Products** | 10 | Organic, minimal processing, whole foods |
| **Mixed Concern Products** | 10 | Multiple issues (high sugar + dyes + allergens) |

**Example Test Cases:**

1. **Skippy Peanut Butter**
   - Ingredients: Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Salt
   - Expected Score: ~65/100
   - Expected Concerns: Major allergen (peanuts), hydrogenated oils (trans fats)

2. **Fruit Loops Cereal**
   - Ingredients: Corn flour blend, sugar, wheat flour, whole grain oat flour, modified corn starch, contains 2% or less of vegetable oil, oat fiber, salt, soluble corn fiber, natural flavor, red 40, yellow 5, blue 1, yellow 6...
   - Expected Score: ~30/100
   - Expected Concerns: High sugar (12g per serving), multiple artificial dyes, low nutritional value

3. **Organic Applesauce (unsweetened)**
   - Ingredients: Organic Apples, Water, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)
   - Expected Score: ~95/100
   - Expected Concerns: None significant

### Ground Truth Creation Process

1. **Manual Expert Annotation**: 
   - Work with nutritionist or use established guidelines to score 20 products manually
   - Document reasoning for each score

2. **Synthetic Generation**:
   - Use GPT-4 to generate 30 additional ingredient lists with known characteristics
   - Example prompt: "Generate an ingredient list for a children's snack bar that contains moderate sugar, no artificial additives, and whole grain ingredients"

3. **Validation**:
   - Cross-check synthetic examples against real product databases
   - Ensure distribution covers all safety score ranges (0-100)

### RAGAS Evaluation Plan

**Metrics to Measure:**

1. **Faithfulness** (0-1 score)
   - *Question*: Are the safety assessments grounded in the retrieved FDA/USDA guidelines?
   - *Method*: Check if claims in the explanation can be attributed to retrieved chunks
   - *Target*: > 0.90 (high faithfulness required for health/safety domain)

2. **Answer Relevancy** (0-1 score)
   - *Question*: Does the response directly address the food safety question?
   - *Method*: Measure semantic similarity between question and response
   - *Target*: > 0.85

3. **Context Precision** (0-1 score)
   - *Question*: Are the retrieved document chunks relevant to the ingredient being analyzed?
   - *Method*: Evaluate if top-K retrieved chunks contain information needed for assessment
   - *Target*: > 0.80

4. **Context Recall** (0-1 score)
   - *Question*: Are we retrieving all relevant guidelines needed for complete assessment?
   - *Method*: Check if ground truth reasoning points are present in retrieved context
   - *Target*: > 0.75

**Baseline Evaluation Process:**

1. Run all 50 test cases through the naive RAG system (single agent, simple retrieval)
2. Collect RAGAS metrics for each test case
3. Calculate average metrics across all categories
4. Identify failure modes and weak performance areas
5. Document specific cases where the system failed

**Expected Baseline Results Table:**

| Metric | Target | Expected Baseline | Gap |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----|
| Faithfulness | > 0.90 | ~0.75 | -0.15 |
| Answer Relevancy | > 0.85 | ~0.80 | -0.05 |
| Context Precision | > 0.80 | ~0.65 | -0.15 |
| Context Recall | > 0.75 | ~0.60 | -0.15 |

*(Actual results will be populated after implementation)*

### Conclusions from Baseline Evaluation

**Expected Findings:**

1. **Low Context Precision**: Naive retrieval likely returns too many irrelevant chunks because ingredient names appear in many contexts (e.g., "sugar" in regulatory text, recipes, multiple guidelines)

2. **Low Context Recall**: Simple semantic search may miss relevant guidelines when technical terminology doesn't match common ingredient names

3. **Faithfulness Issues**: Without proper source attribution, the LLM may hallucinate safety concerns or mix information from different sources

4. **Performance Variance by Category**: Expect better performance on allergen detection (well-defined lists) vs. nutritional evaluation (requires numerical reasoning)

**Identified Improvement Areas:**
- Need better retrieval strategy (hybrid search, re-ranking)
- Metadata filtering to route queries to relevant documents
- Few-shot examples for consistent structured output
- Citation/source tracking for faithfulness

---

## Task 6: Advanced Retrieval Techniques

### Proposed Advanced Retrieval Techniques

#### 1. **Hybrid Search (Semantic + Keyword/BM25)**

**Why**: Ingredient names are often exact terms (e.g., "Red 40", "BHA", "sodium benzoate"). Pure semantic search may not rank exact matches highly. Combining semantic similarity with keyword matching ensures precise ingredient identification.

**Implementation**: 
- Use Qdrant's hybrid search capability
- Weight: 0.6 semantic + 0.4 keyword for optimal balance

#### 2. **Query Decomposition**

**Why**: A complex ingredient list contains multiple distinct items requiring different knowledge. Breaking down "Red 40, High Fructose Corn Syrup, BHA" into separate queries improves retrieval precision for each ingredient.

**Implementation**:
- LLM-powered query decomposition
- Each specialist agent queries for individual ingredients
- Aggregate results

#### 3. **Metadata Filtering**

**Why**: Different agents need different document types. The Allergen Agent should only query allergen databases, not nutritional guidelines.

**Implementation**:
- Tag documents with type metadata: ["allergen_db", "additive_regulation", "nutrition_guideline", "safety_standard"]
- Agents apply filters before vector search

#### 4. **Re-ranking with Cross-Encoder**

**Why**: Initial retrieval (top-20) may include relevant chunks ranked lower. Re-ranking with a more sophisticated model improves top-5 precision.

**Implementation**:
- Retrieve top-20 chunks with hybrid search
- Re-rank with cross-encoder model (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`)
- Return top-5 for LLM context

#### 5. **Parent Document Retrieval**

**Why**: Small chunks optimize retrieval precision but lose surrounding context. When a chunk is retrieved, including its parent section improves LLM understanding.

**Implementation**:
- Store chunk IDs with parent document/section IDs
- When chunk is retrieved, fetch full parent section for LLM
- Provide both chunk (for relevance) and parent (for context)

#### 6. **Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)**

**Why**: Parent questions like "Is Red 40 safe for kids?" may not semantically match guideline text. HyDE generates a hypothetical answer, embeds it, and uses it for search.

**Implementation**:
- Generate hypothetical answer: "Red 40 is an artificial food dye that has been studied for effects on children's behavior..."
- Embed hypothetical answer
- Search with this embedding instead of query embedding

### Testing Plan

**Experiment Design:**

| Experiment | Techniques Combined | Expected Improvement |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Baseline** | Naive semantic search | (baseline) |
| **Exp 1** | Hybrid search only | +10-15% context precision |
| **Exp 2** | Hybrid + Metadata filtering | +20-25% context precision |
| **Exp 3** | Hybrid + Metadata + Re-ranking | +30-35% context precision |
| **Exp 4** | Full stack (all 6 techniques) | +40-50% context precision |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Run each experiment configuration on 50-test dataset
2. Measure RAGAS metrics for each
3. Compare against baseline
4. Analyze per-category performance (allergens vs. additives vs. nutrition)

**Success Criteria:**
- Context Precision > 0.80 (from baseline ~0.65)
- Context Recall > 0.75 (from baseline ~0.60)
- Faithfulness > 0.90 (from baseline ~0.75)

---

## Task 7: Performance Assessment

### Comparison Framework

**Methodology:**

1. **Naive Agentic RAG (Baseline)**
   - Multi-agent architecture with simple semantic search
   - No advanced retrieval techniques
   - Standard chunking (512 tokens, no hierarchy)

2. **Advanced Agentic RAG (Optimized)**
   - Same multi-agent architecture
   - Full advanced retrieval stack (hybrid, re-ranking, metadata filtering, parent retrieval)
   - Hierarchical semantic chunking

**Evaluation Metrics:**

| Metric | Naive RAG | Advanced RAG | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Faithfulness** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Answer Relevancy** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Context Precision** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Context Recall** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Average Response Time** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Avg Tokens per Response** | TBD | TBD | TBD |

*(Table will be populated with actual experimental results)*

### Performance by Category Analysis

Breaking down performance by product type to identify strengths/weaknesses:

| Product Category | Baseline Score | Advanced Score | Notes |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Major Allergens | TBD | TBD | Expected: High performance in both (clear definitions) |
| High Sugar | TBD | TBD | Expected: Improvement with better numeric reasoning |
| Artificial Additives | TBD | TBD | Expected: Major improvement (precise term matching) |
| Clean Products | TBD | TBD | Expected: Minimal difference (simple cases) |
| Mixed Concerns | TBD | TBD | Expected: Significant improvement (complex retrieval) |

### Expected Improvements and Findings

**Hypothesis 1: Advanced retrieval will significantly improve Context Precision**
- **Expected**: +30-40% improvement
- **Reason**: Hybrid search ensures exact ingredient name matching, metadata filtering reduces noise

**Hypothesis 2: Re-ranking will improve Context Recall**
- **Expected**: +15-20% improvement
- **Reason**: Relevant chunks ranked lower in initial retrieval will surface in top-K after re-ranking

**Hypothesis 3: Parent document retrieval will improve Faithfulness**
- **Expected**: +10-15% improvement
- **Reason**: More context allows LLM to make grounded claims with proper understanding

**Potential Trade-offs:**
- **Latency**: Advanced techniques add 1-2 seconds per query (acceptable for use case)
- **Cost**: Additional embeddings and re-ranking increase compute cost (minimal impact)
- **Complexity**: More sophisticated pipeline increases debugging difficulty

### Failure Mode Analysis

Document specific cases where even advanced retrieval struggles:

1. **Novel Ingredients**: Ingredients not in training data or RAG documents
   - *Example*: Brand-new synthetic sweetener approved in 2025
   - *Mitigation*: Tavily search for real-time information

2. **Ambiguous Terms**: Common words used as ingredient names
   - *Example*: "Natural flavoring" (could contain anything)
   - *Mitigation*: Flag ambiguous terms, prompt user for more detail

3. **Conflicting Research**: Different studies showing opposite conclusions
   - *Example*: Some studies show artificial dyes are harmless, others show behavioral impacts
   - *Mitigation*: Present both perspectives, weight by study quality/recency

- Partner with retailer APIs for product availability

#### 9. **Offline Mode**

**Goal**: Enable in-store use without internet

**Approach**:
- Ship pre-computed vector database with mobile app
- Local LLM inference (quantized model)
- Sync updates when connected

#### 10. **Evaluation Improvements**

**Goal**: Move beyond RAGAS to domain-specific metrics

**Custom Metrics**:
- **Score Accuracy**: Compare predicted scores to expert-annotated scores (MAE, RMSE)
- **Critical Allergen Detection Rate**: Recall metric for life-threatening allergens (must be 100%)
- **Parent Satisfaction Score**: User study with real parents
- **Decision Consistency**: Same product should get same score regardless of wording variations
