## Submit Here (Due October 21 by 7:00 PM ET)

[Certification Challenge](https://forms.gle/4viHEd5BgAwW7mbi7)

## Overview

Welcome to the middle of the course!  We’re 5 weeks in and we’ve covered a lot of ground - you all certainly have enough prototyping skill to be dangerous!

At this point, it’s important to consider everything in front of us as a blank page - blue sky!

It’s time to align the general skills we’ve learned (and will continue to learn!) in the specific direction aligned with what you’re aiming at.

What are your goals for the rest of 2025 and into 2026?

How can you build 🏗️, ship 🚢, and share 🚀 your way towards achieving them?

It all starts now, with the Certification Challenge, which will form the basis for your Demo Day project.

Let’s recall where we’ve been and what we’ve covered in the past five weeks

- Introduction,**Vibe Check**,and Context Engineering I
- **Building** Production-Grade **AI Applications**
- Context Engineering II: **Agents & Multi-Agent Systems**
- **Evaluating** AI Applications with **Synthetic** [](https://www.notion.so/c788d5a1487b44908324605399ce33fa?pvs=21)**Data**
- Advanced **Retrievers** & **Agentic Reasoning**

<aside>
💡

Remember, *you know enough already to be dangerous*. You already know enough of the concepts and code you need to build, ship, and share production LLM applications! 

</aside>

And this is what the Certification challenge is all about - putting **your skills to the tes**t!

 

### Setting (Time & ROI) Expectations

During Cohort 7, here is how the numbers shook out. It took an average of 23.2 hours for people to complete the challenge.

![*Note the 90-99 hours; we confirmed with this student that this was total time spent since the beginning of the cohort.](attachment:0defd669-5f1b-4a75-ae84-66345c60c119:image.png)

*Note the 90-99 hours; we confirmed with this student that this was total time spent since the beginning of the cohort.

It’s very much worth considering that the kind of AI Engineering work we’re doing; that is, scoping a problem, creating a solution to that problem that solves a specific pain point for real customers or stakeholders, and engineering it for scale from day 1, is extremely valuable work.

In our opinion, this is the kind of pilot project work that you should be charging $10-20k as a solo consultant.

It is also the kind of work that, after you take a few shots on goal, will become faster and faster for you to knock out.

Finally, it’s worth noting that [Certified AI Engineers](https://aimakerspace.io/certification/#:~:text=LET%27S%20CHAT!-,CERTIFIED%20GRADUATES,-Certified%20Graduates%20are) not only are at the top of hiring lists within our network, but we’ve worked with multiple former students & solo consultants in the past to fill up their plate with project work, and we’ve helped certified students running startups to build out their teams.

What is in your future as an AI Engineer or AI Engineering Leader?

## Introduction

All good stories, like all production AI applications, rely on setting the right context.

What’s the context for your **CERTIFICATION CHALLENGE submission**?

What’s the context for your **Demo Day application**?

That’s the first thing you need to figure out!

- In Cohorts 1-4 of the Bootcamp, we provided the context for students on the Certification. *They didn’t love it, and wished it had more to do with Demo Day.*
- In Cohort 5, ****we made students provide the context.
- In Cohort 6, *we had students provide the context*, and this worked out very well!
- Since Cohort 7, this has proven to be the gold standard - **you are responsible for deciding what to build and why**.

To dial in your use case, we’ll need to leverage some AI Product Management.

### 😎 AI Product Management

<aside>
🤔

AI product management asks “**What** should I build, ship, and share, and why?”

</aside>

There are three primary questions **you need to answer** *before you can begin* the certification challenge:

1. What **problem** are you trying to solve?  
*Why is this a problem?*
2. What is your proposed **solution**?  
*Why is this the best solution?*
3. Who is the **audience** that has this problem and would use your solution?  
*Do they nod their head up and down when you talk to them about it?*

Problem, Solution, Audience. 

That’s really all you need.

From there, you’ll need to do some AI Engineering.

### 🧑‍💻 AI Engineering

<aside>
🤔

AI Engineering asks “**How** should I build, ship, and share, and why?”

</aside>

You will be responsible for helping your current or future companies overcome the illusion of choice.

🙋 “Should I use RAG, agents, or fine-tuning?”

🙋 ”Should I do vibe checking or systematic quantitative evaluation?”

🙋 ”Should I use curated real customer data or synthetic data generation for my golden test sets?”

🙋 ”Should I focus on improving retrieval, generation, or reasoning traces?”

🙋 ”Should I improve performance or cost?”

Answer: 🧑‍💻 ”Yes.” 

Once you know the problem to be solved, you must be capable of guiding your team in making the right tradeoffs.

As we’ll see as we get deeper into production LLM applications, all we do is get deeper into the land of “it depends.” What does it depend on? Well, of course, the definition of the problem you’re trying to solve and how you expect things to change for your audience once you solve it!

## Task 1: Defining your Problem and Audience

**You are an AI Solutions Engineer**.

**What** problem do you want to solve?  **Who** is it a problem for?

<aside>
📝

Task 1: Articulate the problem and the user of your application

*Hints:* 

- *Create a list of potential questions that your user is likely to ask!*
- *What is the user’s job title, and what is the part of their job function that you’re trying to automate?*
</aside>

**✅ Deliverables**

1. Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem
2. Write 1-2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user

    ***Note***: Mani set the gold standard of solution with this one: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mani-sarkar_aie7-aimakerspace-studentloans-activity-7369425852385640449-KAEO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOfOE4BdOGPD97rGOwB0qdCpNDB_wvyxsI
    
    - Introducing FSAId, inspired by some of the [latest news in the United State on Student Loans](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gop-megabill-poised-to-change-the-way-americans-borrow-and-repay-student-loans-56c49da3) 👇
        1. **Problem:** It is hard to get clear, precise answers to questions about student loans and student loan repayment for existing borrowers and potential borrowers, even as a customer service agent within a federal student loan company like [Mohela](https://www.mohela.com/) and [Federal Student Aid](https://studentaid.gov/).
        2. **Why:** 
            1. As student loan repayment continues this summer, the volume of calls is expected to increase in 2025.
            2. As of Q1, 2025, there is $1.777T USD in student loan debt, including $1.693T in Federal student loan debt, affecting 42.7M people in the US. 
            3. I (Dr. Greg) also have student loans, and so this is a problem that is interesting and important to me.
        3. **Success:** Time saved by responding to customer inquiries and complaints.
            - 🧪 Hypothesis: The existing tooling used for search, retrieval, and generation of helpful and useful answers to customer inquiries does not rapidly accelerate an agent’s ability to deal with a large volume of customer complaints per day.
        4. **Audience:** We are building this application for customer service agents who work in Federal Student Loan companies.
        5. **Solution**: We want to build a solution that can answer questions like:
            
            
            | Category | Scenario / Question |
            | --- | --- |
            | **Existing borrowers in repayment** | Customer is complaining that they are unable to pay and they are already 3 months behind on payments – what is the best solution? |
            | **Existing borrowers in repayment** | Customer asserts that they did fill out an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan renewal form, but there is none on record. Customer is insistent. What is the best solution? |
            | **Existing borrowers in repayment** | Customer asserts “I shouldn’t have to pay these back – this is unconstitutional.” How do I respond? |
            | **New borrowers** | Is applying for and securing a student loan in 2025 a terrible idea? |
            | **New borrowers** | How much loan money can I actually get from the government to go to school these days? Is there a cap? |
            | **New borrowers** | What grants and scholarships are available for free? |
            
            **To test this use case**, we should try answering these questions using:
            
            1. The built-in search functionality on [studentaid.gov](http://studentaid.gov) and https://www.mohela.com/ - there appears to be a new chatbot name Aidan on [FSA.gov](http://FSA.gov) too!
            2. ChatGPT 4.1, o3, and Deep Research
            
            **To build our first simple RAG prototype**, we will use the following **policy data** from the [Federal Student Aid website](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/fsa-handbook/pdf/2025-2026).
            
            - [Application and Verification Guide Master File](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/2025-2026/2025-2026_Federal_Student_Aid_Handbook/_knowledge-center_fsa-handbook_2025-2026_application-and-verification-guide.pdf)
            - [Volume 3 - Academic Calendars, Cost of Attendance, and Packaging](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/2025-2026/2025-2026_Federal_Student_Aid_Handbook/_knowledge-center_fsa-handbook_2025-2026_vol3.pdf)
            - [Volume 7 - The Federal Pell Grant Program](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/2025-2026/2025-2026_Federal_Student_Aid_Handbook/_knowledge-center_fsa-handbook_2025-2026_vol7.pdf)
            - [Volume 8 - The Direct Loan Program](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/2025-2026/2025-2026_Federal_Student_Aid_Handbook/_knowledge-center_fsa-handbook_2025-2026_vol8.pdf)
            
            **To take our RAG application to a multi-agent system**:
            
            1. 🧑‍⚖️ **Agent Team 1: Research Team with Policy Expertise** 
            *Responsible for High-Level Background Context*
                1. 🧰 Tools
                    1. RAG Tool: for a general company-specific knowledge base of rules, policies, and regulations
                    2. Tavily Search Tool: for the most relevant and up-to-date information available
            2. 🧑‍💻 **Agent Team 2: Document Writing Team with Case Study Expertise, a Style Guide, and Response Writer Agents**
            *Responsible for Finding Specific Use Cases and Generating Reponses in the Style of our company or institution* 
                1. 🧰 Tools
                    1. RAG Tool: for specific use cases relevant to the user query 
                2. 🕴️ Sub-Agents
                    1. Document Writer Agent, for *initial drafting*
                    2. Copy Editor Agent, for *copy editing*
                    3. Note Taker Agent, for *additional research and citations*
                    4. Empathy Editor Agent, for *empathy, compassion, and customer understanding*
            
            <aside>
            🔁
            
            *Aside: Tools vs. Agents*
            
            It is often difficult to distinguish between tools, single-tool agents, and agent teams.
            
            This is because *we can call a tool an agent* (recall: **Function Calling = Tooling Calling = Reasoning-Action** in one step!), or *we can refer to a single-tool agent as simply a tool*.
            
            Moreover, when we look at an agent with access to tools, if we consider each tool as an agent, then we can quickly be looking at a multi-agent system. 
            
            </aside>
            
            As an example, consider today’s build. We can broadly consider our Supervisor agent to be in charge of two “agent teams,” each with their own supervisor!

## Task 3: Dealing with the Data

**You are an AI Systems Engineer.**  The AI Solutions Engineer has handed off the plan to you.  Now *you must identify some source data* that you can use for your application.  

Assume that you’ll be doing at least RAG (e.g., a PDF) with a general agentic search (e.g., a search API like [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) or [SERP](https://serpapi.com/)).

<aside>
📝

Task 3: Collect data for (at least) RAG and choose (at least) one external API

*Hint:*  

- *Ask other real people (ideally the people you’re building for!) what they think.*
- *What are the specific questions that your user is likely to ask of your application?  **Write these down**.*
</aside>

**✅ Deliverables**

1. Describe all of your data sources and external APIs, and describe what you’ll use them for.
2. Describe the default chunking strategy that you will use.  Why did you make this decision?
3. [Optional] Will you need specific data for any other part of your application?   If so, explain.

## Task 4: Building an End-to-End Agentic RAG Prototype

<aside>
📝

Task 4: Build an end-to-end Agentic RAG application using a production-grade stack and your choice of commercial off-the-shelf model(s)

</aside>

**✅ Deliverables**

1. Build an end-to-end prototype and deploy it to a *local* endpoint
2. (Optional) use locally-hosted OSS models instead of LLMs through the OpenAI API

## Task 5: Creating a Golden Test Data Set

**You are an AI Evaluation & Performance Engineer.**  The AI Systems Engineer who built the initial RAG system has asked for your help and expertise in creating a "Golden Data Set" for evaluation.

<aside>
📝

Task 5: Prepare a test data set (either by generating synthetic data or by assembling an existing dataset) to baseline an initial evaluation with RAGAS.

</aside>

**✅ Deliverables**

1. Assess your pipeline using the RAGAS framework including key metrics faithfulness, response relevancy, context precision, and context recall.  Provide a table of your output results.
2. What conclusions can you draw about the performance and effectiveness of your pipeline with this information?

## Task 6: The Benefits of Advanced Retrieval

**You are an AI Systems Engineer.**  The AI Evaluation and Performance Engineer has asked for your help in making stepwise improvements to the application. They heard that “as goes retrieval, so goes generation” and have asked for your expertise.

<aside>
📝

Task 6: Install an advanced retriever of your choosing in our Agentic RAG application. 

</aside>

**✅ Deliverables**

1. Describe the retrieval techniques that you plan to try and to assess in your application.  Write one sentence on why you believe each technique will be useful for your use case.
2. Test a host of advanced retrieval techniques on your application.

## Task 7: Assessing Performance

**You are the AI Evaluation & Performance Engineer**.  It's time to assess all options for this product.

<aside>
📝

Task 7: Assess the performance of the naive agentic RAG application versus the applications with advanced retrieval tooling
